I'm creating a program to run on windows 10. I want my program to get notified when a user attempts to log in and my program should be able to allow or discard to log in attempt. How can i do that?

Certainly! To achieve this, you can follow these steps:

Event Log Trigger:
Open Task Scheduler on your Windows 10 machine.
Create a new task.
On the General tab, provide a name for your task.
On the Triggers tab, click New and select On an event.
In the Log dropdown, choose Security.
In the Source field, type Microsoft Windows security auditing.
In the Event ID field, enter 4625 (which corresponds to a failed login attempt).
Click OK to save the trigger.
Action:
On the Actions tab, click New.
Choose Start a program.
In the Program/script field, specify the path to your program or script that handles login attempts.
Click OK to save the action.
Conditions (Optional):
On the Conditions tab, uncheck Start the task only if the computer is on AC power (if applicable).
Save your task.
Now, whenever a user attempts to log in and fails, your program will be notified. You can then decide whether to allow or discard the login attempt based on your programâ€™s logic. Remember to adjust the event ID and other settings as needed for your specific use case.

Please note that this approach works for failed login attempts. If you also want notifications for successful logins, you can modify the event ID accordingly123.

You
i want to get notifications for successful logins too
Copilot
Certainly! To receive notifications for both successful and failed login attempts, follow these steps:

Event Log Trigger:
Open Task Scheduler on your Windows 10 machine.
Create a new task.
On the General tab, provide a name for your task.
On the Triggers tab, click New and select On an event.
In the Log dropdown, choose Security.
In the Source field, type Microsoft Windows security auditing.
In the Event ID field:
For failed login attempts, enter 4625.
For successful login attempts, enter 4624.
Click OK to save the trigger.
Action:
On the Actions tab, click New.
Choose Start a program.
In the Program/script field, specify the path to your program or script that handles login attempts.
Click OK to save the action.
Conditions (Optional):
On the Conditions tab, uncheck Start the task only if the computer is on AC power (if applicable).
Save your task.
Now, whenever a user logs in (whether successful or failed), your program will be notified. You can implement your logic to allow or discard login attempts based on the event details. Remember to adjust the event IDs and other settings as needed for your specific use case.

You
does that mean my program can block the user from loging in all together?
Copilot
Yes, your program can indeed prevent users from logging in altogether based on the logic you implement. When your program receives a notification about a login attempt (whether successful or failed), it can analyze the event details and decide whether to allow or block the login.

Here are some scenarios your program can handle:

Allow Login:
If the login attempt is valid (successful), your program can allow the user to proceed with the login process.
Block Login:
If the login attempt fails due to incorrect credentials or suspicious activity, your program can block the user from logging in.
You can implement custom rules (e.g., multiple failed attempts within a short time) to determine when to block a user.
Custom Logic:
Your program can apply additional logic based on specific conditions. For example:
Temporary Lockout: Temporarily block a user after a certain number of failed attempts.
User Roles: Allow or block login based on user roles (e.g., admin vs. regular user).
Geolocation: Block logins from specific regions or IP addresses.
Remember to thoroughly test your program and consider security implications. Blocking users should be done judiciously to avoid unintentional lockouts or denial of service.

Feel free to tailor your programâ€™s behavior according to your requirements! ðŸ˜Š
